                            <p>Tonga is a special place to visit - and if you go at the right time, you will be forever changed by seeing these gentle giants swimming with babies and engaging in heat runs. The excitement level is high on this trip; there’s nothing like hearing the song of a humpback whale as he tries to encourage a female to mate with him. Conservation is top priority among the locals, who do their best to ensure that the whales have a safe place to mate and birth.</p>

                <p>MAR has been organizing small ocean wildlife expeditions for 12 years. We keep our groups small to minimize our impact on the areas we visit and to ensure the animals are not stressed or overwhelmed. This also ensures that our guests can maximize time with the animals. Our company is a tight knit group of conservationists and experts in their fields. All of our employees are passionate about wildlife and conservation. We are all marine biologists and ocean aficionados, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share. We consider each other 'Ohana': a Hawaiian term meaning "family". By the end of your journey you will be part of the MAR Ohana.</p>
